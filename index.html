<p>I will update this when code is finalized and the game is created.</p>

<h2>
<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>

<p>The blockchain challenge is a strange game. If you've done the most work, you become the leader. That's it. Every week the leader changes. It's inspired by the concept of "difficulty" in Bitcoin, and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Button_(Reddit)">The Button</a>" by Reddit. </p>

<p>The game is based on beating the previous difficulty, and a "world record" is stored based on who crushed it the hardest. This world record persists over the course of weeks and stores the account of the record holder.</p>

<p>When you become the leader, you receive any funds in the contract. You also control the message stored in the contract. </p>

<p>You can subscribe to the contract and watch people playing. </p>

<h2>
<a id="strategy" class="anchor" href="#strategy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Strategy</h2>

<p>I suspect that strange strategies will arise from this game. Here were my observations while creating it:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can submit "small" collisions to reset anyone trying a larger collision</li>
<li>You can rush a large collision to prevent small-timers from trying strategy #1 out</li>
<li>You can wait until less people are playing, like "The Button" at reddit</li>
<li>You can simply not make any attempts and avoid pushing the difficulty up, like in an auction</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="abuse--problems--bugs" class="anchor" href="#abuse--problems--bugs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Abuse / Problems / Bugs</h2>

<p>The contract has an admin selfdestruct() in case a bug makes the game no fun or some kind of abuse breaks it down.</p>

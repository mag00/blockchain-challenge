  "body": "##Official Contract Location\r\nI will update this when code is finalized and the game is created.\r\n\r\n##About\r\nThe blockchain challenge is a strange game. If you've done the most work, you become the leader. That's it. Every week the leader changes. It's inspired by the concept of \"difficulty\" in Bitcoin, and \"[The Button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Button_(Reddit))\" by Reddit. \r\n\r\nThe game is based on beating the previous difficulty, and a \"world record\" is stored based on who crushed it the hardest. This world record persists over the course of weeks and stores the account of the record holder.\r\n\r\nWhen you become the leader, you receive any funds in the contract. You also control the message stored in the contract. \r\n\r\nYou can subscribe to the contract and watch people playing. \r\n\r\n##Strategy\r\nI suspect that strange strategies will arise from this game. Here were my observations while creating it:\r\n\r\n1. You can submit \"small\" collisions to reset anyone trying a larger collision\r\n2. You can rush a large collision to prevent small-timers from trying strategy #1 out\r\n3. You can wait until less people are playing, like \"The Button\" at reddit\r\n4. You can simply not make any attempts and avoid pushing the difficulty up, like in an auction\r\n\r\n##Abuse / Problems / Bugs\r\nThe contract has an admin selfdestruct() in case a bug makes the game no fun or some kind of abuse breaks it down.",

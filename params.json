  "body": "##Official Contract Location\r\nThe game is located here: [0x8b4aa759d83ec43efba755fc27923e4a581bccc1](http://etherscan.io/address/0x8b4aa759d83ec43efba755fc27923e4a581bccc1) with verified source code.\r\n\r\nParams below.\r\n\r\n##About\r\nThe blockchain challenge is a very hackable game. If you've done the most computational work, you become the leader. That's it.\r\n\r\nBut, there are ways to disrupt someone else's work...\r\n\r\nEvery week the leader changes. It's inspired by the concept of \"difficulty\" in Bitcoin, and \"[The Button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Button_(Reddit))\" by Reddit. \r\n\r\nThe game is based on beating the previous difficulty, and a \"world record\" is stored based on who has collided (so to speak) the hardest. This world record persists over the course of weeks and stores the account of the record holder.\r\n\r\nWhen you become the leader, you receive any funds in the contract. You also control the message stored in the contract so you can tell us all to vote for Trump. \r\n\r\nThe contract publishes events so you can watch people play in the Mist client.\r\n\r\n##How To Play\r\n1. Download the [official Ethereum wallet](https://www.ethereum.org/).\r\n2. Get a small amount of 'eth' into your wallet. Purchase it from Kraken or Gemini, ask a friend for a small amount, or google for a Ethereum Faucet.\r\n3. Click \"Contracts\"\r\n4. Click \"Watch Contract\"\r\n5. Name is \"Blockchain Challenge\", address is at the top of this page (0x0...), and JSON is in the \"code\" section of that link under \"ABI\".\r\n\r\nOnce you're watching the contract, some functions will be available to you. \r\nThe contract accepts a string in function `Overthrow`. The string will be SHA3 hashed and `XOR`'d with the current `LeaderHash`. If the result is less than the `Difficulty`, your Ethereum address will be stored as the new leader, and the difficulty will equal that amount of effort. You'll then have access to the `Change Leader Message` function in the contract, as it is gated by the leader's address.\r\n\r\n##Strategy\r\nI suspect that strange strategies will arise from this game. Here were my observations while creating it:\r\n\r\n1. You can submit \"small\" collisions to reset anyone trying a larger collision\r\n2. You can rush a large collision to prevent small-timers from trying strategy #1 out\r\n3. You can wait until less people are playing, like \"The Button\" at reddit\r\n4. You can simply not make any attempts and avoid pushing the difficulty up, like in an auction\r\n\r\nThere are others, but I'd like to see some hackers figure it out. Read the source.\r\n\r\n##Abuse / Problems / Bugs\r\nThe contract has an admin selfdestruct() in case a bug makes the game no fun or some kind of abuse breaks it down. Submit a pull request if you think something is broken. I can change this page to reflect the latest game.\r\n",
